**üñ•Ô∏è Laptop Price Prediction üí∞üìä**

As laptops come with a wide range of specifications and features, their prices vary significantly. This project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts the price of a laptop based on key attributes such as brand, processor, RAM, storage, and other hardware specifications. By analyzing a dataset of laptop specifications and prices, this project provides valuable insights for consumers, retailers, and manufacturers. It helps potential buyers estimate the price range of a laptop before purchasing, assists retailers in pricing strategies, and aids manufacturers in understanding pricing trends.
